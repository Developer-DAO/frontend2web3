This is an example post, with a [link](https://nextjs.org) and a React component:

```js

function hello(){
    console.log('sup')
}

```

<ConnectWallet />

The title and description are pulled from the MDX file and processed using `gray-matter`. Additionally, links are rendered using a custom component passed to `next-mdx-remote`.
