# Transcript

**Rahat:** What's up everyone today. We're going to look at how to get the address or ENS username of someone who connects their wallet to your dApp using react and ethers in 60 seconds. So we've got ourselves a react app here. We're importing ethers from the ethers library and useState from react. We set up some state here for the name, which is for now just going to be an empty string.
<br />
<br />
We're using that inside of this H1. I've got this button with this handle wallet connect function, which we've got here this is an async function. It's going to make use of the Ethereum object inside of the window. As long as you have a wallet in your browser, we're going to be able to get access to this. Now we're going to access the ethers library, specifically this web three provider and pass it that Ethereum object.
<br />
<br />
This gives us a little provider, which can do cool things like request the access to the users Ethereum account. We can also get some access to some more information specifically about that account as well. Using this get signer function specifically, though, we want to get the address. Once we have that address, we're going to check to see if they have any ENS username using the provider dot lookup address and passing in that address.
<br />
<br />
We just got as long as this doesn't return null, we're going to set the name to the ENS username, we just got. Otherwise, we're going to set the name to the clunky address. So let's see this in action. When you hit the connect button, giving this access to my account. Number two, and we see rahat.eth is what comes up here.
<br />
<br />
Now, if I change the account. And head over to account one, make sure it's connected hit connect again instead of the Rahat.eth. I now get this address. Thanks for tuning in depending on where you watch this, though, the repository for this code will be either available in the thread or description of the video.
<br />
<br />
Feel free to play around with it and add some actual usernames to your next dApp.
